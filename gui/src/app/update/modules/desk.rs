    /// still unfolding over a cleared workspace with it.

    /// Called whenever the answer can have moved — a fresh reading of the
    /// screens, a configuration that switched the desk off, a monitor that
    /// arrived — because a spring nobody points at never travels, and the
    /// canvas is drawn out of exactly that travel.
    ///
    /// The canvas travels out and snaps back. Unfolding happens on a screen
    /// nobody is using, so it can take its time; folding happens because a
    /// window has just taken the screen, and that window is on it already —
    /// a strip still travelling home while the window waits for it reads as
    /// the bar lagging behind the compositor, so the way back is not
    /// travelled at all.
    ///
    /// The returned task hands the canvas its pointer input, or takes it
    /// away: the surface spans the whole screen, so one left taking presses
    /// while it is folded away would swallow every press meant for the
    /// desktop under it.
